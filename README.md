# Accessibility Audit Tool

Most accessibility tools give you a snapshot in time. This one gives you a timeline. It doesn't just scan your site; it tracks your progress, highlights regressions, and tells you exactly when a new bug was introduced.

No dashboards, SaaS platforms, or magic abstractions. Just a simple goal:

> **Run an accessibility audit, understand the results, and fix real problems without fighting the tooling.**

---

## Features

- Uses **axe-core** for reliable WCAG checks
- Audits multiple pages per run
- Outputs results in **HTML, CSV, and JSON**
- Clear, rule-grouped HTML report with collapsible sections
- **Audit history with automatic diffs** between runs
- Highlights **new, resolved, and unchanged** violations
- Rule-level and page-level **change indicators**
- Filenames include **site name + timestamp** for traceability
- Keeps raw axe output intact for debugging or reprocessing
- **Inline HTML embedding** for instant results in the web UI
- Cancel audits mid-run and safely stop Puppeteer/browser processes
- Handles Ctrl+C in the terminal for graceful shutdown

## Requirements

- Node.js **18+** (ESM required)
- npm or equivalent package manager

### Dependencies

- `@axe-core/puppeteer`
- `puppeteer`
- `express`
- `json2csv`
- `axios`
- `xml2js`

---

## Usage

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Optionally, `dev-launcher.js` can auto-open the browser for convenience.

### 3. Run audits manually

**Fetch pages**

```bash
npm run fetch-urls
```

**Run accessibility audits**

```bash
npm run run-audit
```

**Process results**

```bash
npm run process-results
```

**Run full workflow**

```bash
npm run audit
```

## Output Details

### HTML Report

* Summary section at the top:
  * Pages audited
  * New issues
  * Resolved issues
  * Active rules
* Rule sections are collapsible and show per-page occurrences
* Only the offending element is displayed by default; multiple occurrences per page are summarized
* **Priority items callout** appears when 15 or more rules are broken, showing the most critical or impactful violations first
* Rule headers include:
  * **Impact level** badge (Critical → Minor)
  * **WCAG level** badge (A, AA, AAA)
  * Change indicators since last audit (new / resolved / unchanged)
* Fully resolved rules since last audit appear in a dedicated “🎉 Fully Resolved” section
* Clicking a priority item in the summary scrolls to and expands the corresponding rule in the report
* Inline embedding supported for web UI — the report HTML can be opened directly in a browser or embedded in a web page

### CSV

* One row per violation instance
* Useful for spreadsheets, issue tracking, or bulk triage

### JSON (Processed)

* Structured, grouped representation of violations
* Ideal for automation or custom reporting

## Audit History & Diffs

Each audit run is treated as a snapshot in time.

When a new audit is processed, results are automatically compared
against the **previous run for the same site**, allowing you to see:

- Which violations are **new**
- Which violations were **resolved**
- Which violations remain **unchanged**

Diffs are calculated at the rule and occurrence level and surfaced directly in the HTML report
and web UI. History tracking is available at both rule-level and page-level, and feeds the summary
and priority items sections, so you can see exactly which violations are new, resolved, or still active.

This makes the tool useful not just for one-off audits, but for
tracking accessibility progress over time.

---

## Design Philosophy

* **Transparency over cleverness** – raw data is preserved
* **Semantic HTML first** – no ARIA gymnastics in the reports
* **Predictable output** – filenames encode context and time
* **History-aware** – audits are meant to be compared, not forgotten
* **Hackable** – scripts are meant to be edited, not worshipped

This tool is opinionated in favor of *understanding* accessibility issues, not just counting them.

---

## Notes & Known Issues

* Axe rules around landmarks (e.g. `<main>`, `<nav>`) can surface false positives when legacy ARIA patterns are used
* This tool does not attempt to "fix" axe results — it reports them faithfully
* Always validate findings manually, especially for structural and landmark rules

---

## Future Improvements (Ideas)

* Rule severity summaries
* Page-level grouping toggle
* Optional screenshot capture per violation
* CI-friendly exit codes by severity
* Multi-site audits with centralized storage
* Improved frontend animations
